# ENEE150 â€“ C and Computer Systems

Welcome to the **ENEE150** repository!  
This repo contains notes, resources, and examples for the course. ENEE150 is a second-semester class at the University of Maryland focusing on intermediate low-level programming in **C** and **computer systems** concepts.

## About
My name is **Aman**, and I am an **Undergraduate Teaching Fellow (UTF)** for this course. Iâ€™ll be maintaining this repo to share helpful material and clarifications as the semester progresses. You can expect code examples, notes, and resources from me here, looking forward to meeting you!

## How to Use this Page
You will find that I have broken content down into folders(should be visible above the readme for those of you new to Github). Some files will be readable the same way this is, and others may be C programs for example which you should compile and modify to learn about the behaviour of the language. In the beginning, I'll leave comments to help guide this exploration, but students will find themselves exceling as they take this initiative into their own hands. I'll also go through this during the first discussion.

## NOTES ON SUBMITTING HOMEWORK
It should be submitted on ELMS under the hw1 assignment. Please submit it as a zip file with your .c files in the zip. More to come, but this is the situation for now. Thanks!
